***Modbus
Modbus is a polling protocol. Master interrogates its slaves. Master can poll slave point by point or it can poll by the range of data point. 
Slave cannot initate communication to master device. The master request the data then only the slave can initate the communication.

Type: Simple Master-Slave protocol.
Architecture: The master (SCADA server) requests data, and the slave (field device) responds.
Communication: Polling-based (master constantly queries the slave for data).

Modbus:

    Data is handled using simple register and coil addresses:
        Discrete Inputs: Read-only boolean values.
        Coils: Read/Write boolean values.
        Input Registers: Read-only numerical values.
        Holding Registers: Read/Write numerical values.
    No concept of event-driven data or time-stamped data.

Commonly used on serial (RS-232/RS-485) and TCP/IP networks.
Simple data exchange, best suited for small networks

Modbus:

    No built-in security features (data transmitted as plaintext).
    Vulnerable to replay attacks and unauthorized access.

***DNP3
similarly, master can poll slaves. slaves can initiate communication to master devices.
this is called Unsolicited messaging: sending data to master without master polling the slaves.
allows slaves devices to send event to the master.

Advanced Master-Slave with event-driven capability.
Architecture: Master polls the slave but also allows unsolicited reporting where the slave can send critical data without being polled.
Communication: Both polling and event-driven communication supported.

Data is categorized into classes and objects:

    Class 0: Static data (current values).
    Class 1-3: Event-driven data with different priorities.

Supports time-stamped data, useful for historical analysis and fault recording.

Designed for use over serial, Ethernet, and wireless networks.
Better suited for larger, geographically distributed networks with noisy environments.

DNP3:

    Secure Authentication (DNP3-SA) available for encryption and data integrity.
    More secure compared to Modbus but not as modern as protocols like IEC 61850.


DNP3 poll categories:
class 0
class 1 
class 2 
class 3

Slave responds with the Master-specified data "class" category

polls can also be classified as:
static data poll: polls for all event data from slaves buffer..... AKA integrity polll
event poll: polling to slaves for data on a class-by-class basis..... from class 0 to 3



DNP3 (Distributed Network Protocol version 3) is a communication protocol primarily used in SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems for reliable and secure data transmission between control systems and remote devices.
It is widely used in industries like power utilities, water treatment, and transportation systems.
